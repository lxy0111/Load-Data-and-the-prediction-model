# Load-Data-and-the-prediction-model
Load Data Code file include the code of how to load the capacity grading data, the formation data, and the cycling data of different battery.

Battery Life Prediction Model file include the code of how to generate the training X set cosisting of capacity grading data and the charge/dishcarge data of the first 10 cycles, named as Concat_Capacit_Grading_data_of_X_set and Concat_Cycling_Data_of_X_set, and the training Y set of the life of batteries, named as Y_set. The code Model and Restore_the_model is the battery lifetime prediction model and the method of restoring the model, respectively.
